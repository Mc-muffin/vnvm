translation.add(59, "Well, it's not so much a side job as a secret\noccupation. It's been going on for generations.", "Liliana");
translation.add(60, "It boils down to a secret service. Espionage, you\nknow? We don't just trade.", "Liliana");
translation.add(61, "Although it isn't really befitting a princess like\nme, so I don't like it much.", "Liliana");

translation.add(70, "Yeah, I can kind of tell. You're reliable, and you\nremind me of my sister.", "Arata");
translation.add(71, "Shock!! Then you can't see me as a potential love\ninterest!?", "Liliana");
translation.add(72, "I didn't mean it like that. It's just that you\nresemble my sister.", "Arata");
translation.add(73, "Then, then, do you like older women, Arata?", "Liliana");
translation.add(74, "Hmmm, I have no particular like or dislike for\nolder women. I don't think age really matters.", "Arata");
translation.add(75, "Ohhhhhh! Such an open mind you have! That's why\nyou're my prince!", "Liliana");
translation.add(76, "So, how old are you? About the same age as\nShizuka?", "Arata");
translation.add(77, "Y, yeah! Something like that, ohohohohoho.", "Liliana");
